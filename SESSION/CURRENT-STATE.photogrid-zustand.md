# PhotoGrid + Zustand Current State

## 🎯 What's Implemented

### **Zustand Stores** 📦
- `stores/poseStore.ts` - Manages selectedPose (Pose | null), workingPoses (first 3 poses)
- `stores/navigationStore.ts` - Manages BottomSheet open/close states
- `stores/index.ts` - useAppStores() hook to access all stores

### **PhotoGrid Component** 🖼️
- `components/ui/PhotoGrid/PhotoGrid.tsx` - 2 cards (Library Pose + Gallery), opens 2 different BottomSheets
- Shows selected pose name when pose is chosen
- Library card → Regular BottomSheet at 60%, Gallery card → Modal BottomSheet

### **Rebuilt PoseGrid** 🔄
- `components/PAGE/pose-library/components/PoseGrid.tsx` - 3 working poses in one row
- Uses Zustand: `const { pose } = useAppStores()` and `setSelectedPose(selectedPose)`
- Selection closes BottomSheet to 30% via callback

## 📊 Data Flow

1. **User clicks Library Pose card** → PhotoGrid opens BottomSheet at 60%
2. **User selects working pose** → PoseGrid calls `setSelectedPose()` → Updates Zustand store
3. **Selection callback** → PhotoGrid receives callback → BottomSheet snaps to 30%
4. **PhotoGrid updates** → Shows selected pose name from Zustand state

## 🔧 Current Issues

### **Zustand Not Working** ❌
- Store files created but may not be properly initialized
- Import paths might be incorrect (`@/types/dream` vs `@/types/dream/pose`)
- Missing store provider or initialization

### **Integration Problems** 🔌
- PhotoGrid added to index page but may not be connecting to stores
- PoseGrid rebuilt but original functionality may be broken
- Callback chain between components needs verification

## 📂 Files Modified
- ✅ `stores/*` - New Zustand architecture
- ✅ `components/ui/PhotoGrid/PhotoGrid.tsx` - New component
- 🔄 `components/PAGE/pose-library/components/PoseGrid.tsx` - Rebuilt for 3 poses
- 🔄 `components/PAGE/pose-library/index.tsx` - Added callback support
- 🔄 `components/PAGE/index/index.tsx` - Added PhotoGrid for testing

## 🚨 Next Actions Needed
1. **Debug Zustand**: Check if stores are actually working
2. **Test PhotoGrid**: Verify BottomSheet behavior and state updates
3. **Fix Integration**: Ensure all components properly connect to stores
4. **Remove Test Code**: Clean up index.tsx when working
